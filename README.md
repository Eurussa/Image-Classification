# Vision Transformer (ViT) with CIFAR-10

This repository contains an implementation of Vision Transformer (ViT) for image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The project explores the application of transformer architectures, commonly used in NLP, to image classification tasks.

## 🎯 Project Goals
- Implement Vision Transformer (ViT) for image classification.
- Train and evaluate the model on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

## 🌟 Features
- Utilizes PyTorch's Vision Transformer (ViT) module for image classification tasks.
- Includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.

## 🛠️ Setup and Requirements
This project is designed to run in the Google Colab environment, where the necessary libraries can be installed and executed directly.
